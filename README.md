# dotfiles
Repository that contains all of my configurations and dotfiles I use on a daily basis.
* The setup.sh is only designed for RHEL-based 

## Usage
If you have a fresh install of a RHEL-based distro (RHEL, Fedora, CentOS) you can use the install script.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewpi/dotfiles/master/setup.sh | sudo bash
```
